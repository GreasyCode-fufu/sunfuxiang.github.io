&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🥘2021年6月1日，星期三，多云。早上8点40左右起床，洗完澡10点左右到实训楼，来时看到王晗她们在实训楼前拍毕业合影，刚在微信公众号上看到一篇文章，很好很好，公众号名字叫‘杨国斌的精神家园’，杨老师的公众号是微信推荐功能推荐给我的，杨老师在公众号上记录自己的生活，读来很亲切，很接地气，杨老师现在是华北水利水电大学马克思主义学院教授，本科也在河南师范大学读书。

##### 摘抄

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 如果爱就深爱，这个爱绝不是一味护短，看到它的缺陷就要想法设法尽力弥补，积极建言献策！明明看到不对的地方却文过饰非甚至假装看不见，那不是爱而是害，是自己的明哲保身在作怪！鲁迅当年深刻批判我们国民性 ，陈独秀在《觉醒年代》中大声疾呼中国是胡适之太多了而那个死掉的北大的学生太少了就是这个意思。我们所在的单位所在的国家可能还有这样那样不太好的地方甚至对不起你，但是正因为如此我们才要奋发有为尽快改变现状而不是冷眼冷语袖手旁观。

   如果爱就深爱，要有大爱不要自私自利，干什么事情首先想着对自己有什么好处，对自己有好处的就着急忙慌，对自己没有好处没有关系的置若罔闻，岂不知我们都是需要同舟共济的，如果人人只关心自己的一亩三分地而置整体不管不问，那一个单位一个国家怎么可能建设好？杨靖宇将军对一个劝他投降的人说，如果一个个中国人都为了自己的生计投降了，还有中国吗？

 &nbsp;&nbsp;如果爱请深爱，要努力本职工作，坚定不移矢志不移，时刻具备能力，不要朝三暮四朝秦暮楚，只要人人都努力工作，在自己的工作岗位上出彩，发挥自己的优势，不断奉献自己的智慧和力量，一个单位一个国家怎么可能建设不好呢？最讨厌那些对别人营营苟苟说三道四，真正让他去干一干的时候他又说自己这不行那不行的，理由一大堆，条件一箩筐，推诿扯皮，而自己肚里脑袋里始终空空如也。

   您所在的就是中国，您什么样中国就什么样？！您所在的就是河南，您什么样河南就什么样？！您所在的就是华水，您什么样华水就什么样？！

​    如果爱，请深爱，抛弃徘徊犹豫、抛却胆怯羞涩，大胆热烈直接深沉的爱，深刻的爱，深远的爱！

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🚩2021年6月2日，星期三，天气晴，刚才突然刮风下起了雨，只下了一小会儿，昨天洪立和我去吃饭时洪立告诉我如果要考研最好把每个阶段学习什么做好规划。鹿军前天去的郑州亚信，刚看到QQ群消息他要被调到武汉一个月，每周工作六天半，每天早上9点上班，晚上10点下班。如此看来，学校里的生活确实是一生中最好的时间段，工作了根本没有时间谈恋爱，也没有时间去学习，可恶！今天把高考3500单词过完了一遍，在学校收二手书那里买了3本英语书，下午做了一篇英语真题阅读理解，生词很多，各种考研经验贴上都强调每天背单词，这一点，我一定要做到。上周在新联楼预约了心理咨询，到现在还没给我打电话，自己感觉也没什么问题，就是想去看看心理咨询都干些什么，听说外边心理咨询一小时要好几百。下午去吃饭时遇到麦超杰，他也是退役学生，和胡幸举一个班，去年就在学校外边开了家面馆儿。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🚗2021年6月3日，星期四，天气晴，早上8点多起床，9点左右班里，中午午休了一个多小时，要缩短午休时间！中午饭前给我妈打了视频电话，昨天我爸发微信说‘孙好想不好好学习，死不听话’，今天打视频把孙好想说了一顿，当然她很不屑听我说她，孙好想脾气比我大的多，谁打她她都还手，我打她她还手，我妈打她她还手，我没见我爸打过她。性格难道是出生就带的？我和她性格完全相反，我像我爸，听话老实，好想像我妈，大大咧咧。摘抄一段2021年政治考研题目的短文，这段话对人生指导也有很好的作用。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;👒2021年6月4日，星期五，天气晴。昨晚大概4点左右睡着，这两天我总是失眠，昨晚10点多我和成炤桦在实训楼的后边，我们叫它‘后山’，我们在这里走了走，天气凉爽，很不错，成炤桦拍了些照片

<div align=center> <img src="../img/花朵.jpg" width=400></div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;我问她我送的花是不是已经在垃圾桶了，她说‘没有，把花风干了，要留起来’。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;上午看到一个有意思的脑筋急转弯

Three tourists stop at a hotel, and the manager tells them that a shared room will cost $30. Finding the price agreeable, they pony up $10 each and retire to the room. Later that afternoon, the manager, who is honest, realizes that the room was meant to be priced at $25. The manager orders the bellhop to return the excess $5 to their guests. The bellhop, who is not honest, takes $5 from the register and return only $1 to each tourist, pocketing the remaining $2—the guests don’t have to fuss over uneven change that way.

Now, each of the three tourists has spent $9, for a total of $27. The bellhop has retained $2, which brings the total to $29. Where did the other dollar go?

The puzzle uses mathematical sleight of hand to put together an equation, 3 × 9 + 2 = 29, that appears to model the situation described, but really it does not. By juxtaposing dollars spent with dollars held, the equation manages to double-count some dollars while failing to represent others, leaving a total that is just slightly off what we would expect.

Most of us learned in school that it is an error to add measurements that have different units: ten meters and five minutes don’t add up to fifteen of anything. This puzzle teaches us that the inverse is not true: two measurements that have the same unit attached (dollars, in this case) may still sum to a value that represents nothing meaningful.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;自己看了好几遍，把解析也看了一遍，才发现其中的错误，把这个发给了孙好想，她立刻发现了错误,下午跑了5km。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🚙2021年6月7日，星期一，天气晴。昨天和朱沛琳发微信，她说她和她对象已经分手了。我感觉在现实中男女双方个人具备的某些‘力量’要相差不大才可能会结婚或谈恋爱，谈恋爱可能没有太多条件，可能是他或她长的漂亮，男生对女生好或时刻关心女生，便可以谈恋爱，但现实是一旦毕业，就会考虑到结婚，这时态度便会产生变化，在‘力量’强的的一方便可随意提出分手，‘力量’弱的一方就很被动，没有什么竞争力加持在身，一旦对方厌倦了这种感觉，便可随时抛弃你。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;我的现实感受就是如此，朱沛琳对象大专毕业，现已外工作2年，他追的朱沛琳，上次帮朱沛琳修电脑时朱就直言给我说道她不想和她对象谈恋爱了。反观自己，也是如此，自己退伍找周梦洁，自己失去了身处部队的价值，失去了上军校做军官的价值，自己也是被分手者。只有不断提高自己的‘力量’才是万事之本。下午发现了一个Moviepy模块，可以制作视频。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🚛2021年6月9日，星期三，多云，早上6点30左右起床，看到邮箱有一个38岁的西班牙人给我发了邮箱，内容如下

Hi Sun:

I saw your email on the Students of the World website and I would very much like you to accept my friendship. . I am waiting that we will become good friends. ¿In which city do you live?

 

Your friendship is welcome and appreciated. We can talk about many topics and share many things. 
Well, my name is Roge (diminutive of Rogelio) (Roger); I am Special Education teacher (disabilities), I also studied half of the Psychology degree and two postgraduate degrees and the Doctorate. I am currently working as a teacher and research at the University of Murcia. I am 38 years old.


University classes began on September 15. From September to December three subjects I teach two groups of 4th year master degree in Primary Education. It's nice to find among students, familiar faces. I mean that many of my students who are now in 4th year, I gave them when they were in class 1 college course. That is, we are old acquaintances.

At University he taught subjects related to intellectual disability, physical disability, hearing impairment, visual impairment and learning in reading, writing and Mathematics problems.


I live in Murcia capital, located in the southeast of Spain. In my family we are three: my mother (my father died last October 25,2017), a brother and me. I live in an apartment myself, although very close to my parents' home.

I think it's good to find friends with whom to share many things and good times, although sometimes people act selfishly, or simply have their lives made, family responsibilities, etc. and it is difficult to coincide or remain, or they have distanced themselves.

As for my hobbies I like to read a lot (historical novel, best sellers, adventure novel, science fiction, horror, classic and contemporary literature); cinema, in all its genres (comedy, mystery, action, science fiction, horror, musicals, police, etc.). In my apartment I have a good library with more than 1,200 books

I think and believe that friendship should be valued above social, political, religious, cultural, sexual, racial, and economic differences and that it is very enriching to know people from different places, countries, races, etc. respecting the whole world and offering and sharing the best of each one of us.

I like to go out with my friends (I do not have many, I've been practically alone since people have been married, has left work to other cities, or simply, have not kept contact) to walk, to the cinema, to have a coffee, a beer (in moderation), or an ice cream and above all to talk.

 When I have free time I usually go for a walk, ride a bike, and in the summer I love to walk along the seashore (I walk about 15 kilometers a day), sunbathe, swim and play beach volleyball, although I have to confess that during this year due to work I have led a somewhat sedentary life and I have to put my batteries and use myself thoroughly in sports (do not expect to find an Olympic athlete, but not a round obelix type fat ball).

I love to travel, although most of the time I do it is for professional reasons, although there is always a little bit of time to do some tourism. In Spain I know a few cities like: Madrid, Toledo, Barcelona, Zaragoza, Palma de Mallorca, A Coruña, Santiago de Compostela, Granada, Cordoba, Seville; in Italy, Milan and Genoa and in Scotland, Glasgow and Edinburgh and last year I visited Paraguay for professional reasons).

I will be very happy to help you to progress in the English language and you have total freedom and confidence to talk and ask about any topic you want., I want to explain many things about the culture, history, traditions, festivals, monuments, gastronomy of Spain. You can also ask what you want about my life, now you are my friend, I trust you and I am an open book for you

 

¿Can you send me some pictures of you?

I await your news. And of course I'm going to keep writing to you.
I appreciate your friendship

Please send me some pictures of you with your new mail to meet you
Many hugs

Your friend

##### 我的回复

Hello Mr. Roge:

 I am honored to receive your reply. It's great to meet you online. I come from Henan Province, China. I am 23 years old. I am currently studying for my undergraduate degree at Henan Normal University. My major is computer technology.

 In daily life, I like running and reading books, such as literature books, IT technology books and so on. When I received your email yesterday, it was 1:00 a.m. here. When you receive this email from me, is it already evening in your place? In your email, I read that you have a personal library, which is really an exciting thing. As a Chinese saying goes, "Read 10,000 books and travel 10,000 miles." I look forward to your way of life. My English level is not very good, may not be so precise in the expression, please forgive me. I would also like to make friends with your students.

 In my country, Facebook is not available, but I feel E-mail is also a good way to communicate. Below the email is my photo. I don't know how to reduce the size of the photo. Please forgive me.😅

 I hope everything with you is fine.

“慈不掌兵 情不立事 义不理财 善不为官”。白话翻译是：“带领军队必须要狠，心慈手软的人干不了；讲情面成就不了大事；掌管财务必须认真负责。讲义气，不把钱当回事的人做不了；心地善良的人，做不了官。”

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;👕2021年6月10日，星期四，天气晴，上午学校在图书馆前有学位授予仪式，昨下午跑了5km, 在西区操场收到了西班牙老外的邮件，他给我发了好几个邮件，有他写的文字邮件和他的照片还有他生活的城市照片。内容如下

Dear little brother and friend Sun:

Thank you for your message and your friendship . Please call me Roge (short for my name). My family and friends call me that. Now you are my friend, my little brother and you are part of my family 

¿Your name is Sun and your last name is Fuxiang? Or on the contrary, ¿your name is Fuxiang and your last name is Sun? I want to call you by your first name correctly

Please ¿can you send me some pictures of yourself to meet you?

I deeply appreciate the confidence you have in me to talk to me, about you, about your feelings, emotions and needs. Sometimes it's good to have someone to share what happens to us in our lives, to talk, to exchange ideas, opinions, or just to have someone to lean on and give us advice, guide us and give us encouragement and strength to go on in bad times or when we feel emotionally fragile and needy. I consider myself and my friends, always, I tell you sincerely, from the heart, without expecting anything in return or demand anything.

I will be very happy that you explain me about the culture of your country, its customs, monuments, landscapes, gastronomy, people ... and I will also explain about Spain

Don't worry, we can talk about many issues about what is happening in the world at a political, social, cultural level, etc. I will be delighted to share with you

My father's name was Fulgencio; my father died three years ago as a result of Parkinson's disease. My mother's name is Carmen and my brother's name is Antonio. My mother is already retired or retired from work. My father worked as an administrative commercial company and then worked as an Administrative at a Health Center. My mother worked as an Infant Education teacher an orphanage, with children from birth to 6 years old.

My brother studied French studies at the University of Murcia. In France (Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques) he made his Master  and he made his doctoral thesis. The theme of his thesis was a comparative study of Spanish navigators (Domingo de Bonaechea) and the French navigator (Bougainville) of the seventeenth century on his trips to Tahiti.

My brother has a degree in languages in French, English, Italian and Portuguese. And it is also Tourist Guide. I only know a little French and English.

I explain a little about myself, about my studies and about my work

I, am Doctor of Pedagogy (Special Education = study and education and rehabilitation treatment of disabilities )

I'll explain: I have not studied Medicine, I do not work at the level of health. The PhD degree is an academic at the University level. There are several levels:

-Diploma (3 years of College)

-Degree (5 years College)

-Postgrado And Master (2 years of specialization)

-Doctor (1 year training and research profile)

I am Degree in Pedagogy (Special Education). Then I made two Postgraduate: Specialist in Human Psychomotricity; and Therapist in Down Syndrome. And finally I did my PhD and Research (Thesis) on children with visual impairments.

I worked for several years as a teacher of psychomotor development in people with Down Syndrome and blind children.

And  I am Doctor in  Special Education

I currently work as a teacher and researcher at the University.

It may be surprising how sometimes reading a book makes you make a decision that can directly affect a person for the rest of your life. Precisely during my time as a student at the Institute did reading the autobiography of Helen Keller, deafblind, whose teacher Anne Sullivan taught him and made him understand language mixed success (Sign Language) in the palm of the hand, bringing it into contact with the world, people and culture. And despite his severe disabilities, Helen Keller became his doctorate in 1904 and lectured worldwide. This book exerted a great impact in my emotional and influential. Although my grandfather and my mother were teachers, me, not by family influence, but just by reading that book, I had decided I wanted to be a teacher of the blind. And to finish the Bachelor, I studied Education (Special Education) at the University, I did my doctoral thesis on blind children currently impart a course on visual impairment in the University, I have written five books on visual impairment and have completed an research into accessibility for the blind and low vision to art and museums in the city of Murcia. All this thanks to reading a book that made my life take a particular course.

Sometimes dreams change as we become adults. When I was a child of 5 years, I said I wanted to be an astronaut and travel to the Moon and planets unknown. Then I wanted to be a scientist and build robots that were physically like humans. Then he wanted to study ecology. Later I studied Pedagogy (Special Education) and I am a teacher and researcher at the University... My job allows and obliges me to write journal articles, book chapters and books related to special education and disabilities.

I also want to be a writer of literature and become successful. I really like write poetry and short stories. I've even started to write a novel, but I need time for writing.

I have always fascinated me diving; I think that the seabed is a new and beautiful world to explore and learn, but I've never made this experience. In Cabo de Palos (La Manga del Mar Menor beach, Murcia, Spain) there are several centers to learn to dive and organize outings. Maybe one day I decided to learn to dive. It's nice to see the fish, corals, algae, jellyfish, starfish, etc. And there is the advantage that in this part of the Mediterranean there are no sharks

In the little free time that I have I've been investigating and gathering information over the Internet and several books on a subject that even the inhabitants of Murcia themselves ignore or know him only superficially and will explain wishing that you find interesting and entertaining: The shipwreck of the transatlantic Sirio in Cabo de Palos (La Manga, Murcia, Spain), (4 August 1906)

I really love the sea and want to live all year on the beach in La Manga, but it is not possible, as are about 90 km to travel each day to the city of Murcia, where I work and live normally

One of my hobbies is writing poetry and short stories. When I was a student in high school, each course won a prize for Literature. Then I've been writing articles, papers and some books to educational level, but I've never tried to publish a literary book. I would try to publish a novel.

You can ask the questions you want about me or about my life, I am an open book for you. I have full confidence in you. Now you are my little brother and my friend.

The history of Spain is multicultural. More than 2000 years ago lived in Spain some people called Iberians. After the town was settled by the Celts and the people of the Phoenicians. Phoenicians founded a city called Carthage in North Africa and in Spain founded a city called Carthago Nova (now that city exists in my area and called Cartagena. The city of Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, named after the city of Cartagena, Spain.

Later, Spain was occupied by the Roman people. After the end and destruction of the Roman Empire, Spain was occupied by the barbarians of northen Europe, the Visigoths, the Swabians, Vandals and Alans.

Subsequently, Spain was invaded by the Muslim peoples of the North Africa, which remained occupied for 8 centuries. During this time there were periods of peace, prosperity and culture and also of battle and wars between Muslim invaders and Christian inhabitants of Spain.

Finally, all Spain was conquered and liberated by Catholic Monarchs in the fifteenth century, were expelled from the kingdom of Granada to the latter one Muslim Calph .

The current Spanish are the result of the coexistence and misture of all these peoples and cultures throughout history.

Indeed, in Spain we have an immigrant population from other countries, quite large. We have Muslim immigrants (Morocco, Algeria, Senegal, etc...), immigrants from Latin America (Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Argentina, etc.), immigrants from countries of Eastern Europe (Bulgaria, Ukraine, Romania, etc.) and Eastern immigrants (China, mainly).

Spain is a country of many contrasts both landscapes (forests,mountains, plateaus almost without vegetation, rivers, lakes...) and which (in North Spain rains a lot and it is very cold, in the South, winters are mild and pleasant spring, but the summers are very hot.)

In my country the official and foremost language they speak everyone is Spanish; However, not be if you know that in next Spain to the Spanish there are other co-official languages spoken in certain regions of the country. For example, in addition to the Spanish is also speak the following languages: Galician, Basque, Catalan and Valencian.

The Spanish cuisine and gastronomy cuisine specifically Murcia is varied and rich: omelette, eggplant pie, paella, vegetables (potatoes, onions, zucchini, artichoke) stuffed with minced meat) etc.

When you come to Murcia prepare for you a dessert or sweet called "torrijas". It is made with bread, eggs, milk, sugar, olive oil, cinnamon and grated lemon rind. It's delicious .

Sun I would like very much to meet you in person and I hope that one day in the future you can come on holiday to Spain. Both in my apartment in Murcia and in our second residence in La Manga del Mar Menor beach, my house is your home and you can stay for free with us. There is a bedroom just for you. Here you have your Spanish family.

I want to establish with you a deep, sincere friendship, with great confidence, a friendship lifelong I'm looking forward your news

A big hug for you

##### 摘抄

一个国家推行教育的目的，主要是为国家未来的健康发展培养优秀的人才。中国是一个非常看重教育的国家，而影响中国形成目前这种教育现状的原因有以下两个：

**第一个是来自于家庭，因为中国父母都希望自己的孩子比自己更成功，希望孩子能够出人头地。**所谓的“望女成凤，望子成龙”，是从中国古代就开始有的文化教育特征，只要孩子读书了，家长就希望孩子成功。这个特征发展到现代高考，就演变成只要孩子们能考上北大清华，既能“光宗耀祖”，孩子又能前途无量。这样的家庭，父母就会对孩子的学习提出压迫性的要求。

**第二是来自于中国式学校教育，学校教育本来是以知识教育为主，目标是让学生对知识产生好奇心，不断去探索知识，培养创新型知识人才，但是中国的国情使得学校教育最后变成单一的、以高考成功为最终目的的教育。**在中国，大多数教师的考核指标都是以自己的学生中有多少能通过中考、高考，多少能够考上好学校为准的，并直接跟教师奖金挂钩，而教师的奖金跟他们的生计是息息相关的。从这个意义上来说，教师让学生学习知识，本身并不是为了帮助学生产生对知识的好奇心，而是为了让学生最后能考高分上好大学。而考上好大学之后，教师一般来说就不会再那么注重学生的学习情况了。

**毫无疑问，中国在重视教育的表面之下，实际上犯了比较严重的错误。中国教育最核心的病症是 “比较”。**例如，家长把自己孩子跟别家的孩子“比较”，希望自己孩子考上最好的大学；教师将孩子与孩子进行“比较”，希望通过“比较”的方式激发孩子学习积极性，但是最后的结果往往适得其反。

**一个人长期处于“比较”的状态，就很容易出问题。**第一个问题是会养成孩子“比较”自己跟他人优劣的习惯。如果他的参照物总是别人，这就会让他忽视自身的健康发展，偏离自己最终期待的结果。在参照过程中，孩子会过度关注别人，以及在意别人的看法，这会影响他的心理健康。比如，他跟别人比较后，觉得自己比别人优秀，就会变得骄傲甚至自负；当他跟别人比较后，发现自己比别人差，会感到自卑，或是内心很看不起自己。这样的“比较”会导致他不能正确看待自己与他人。

**第二个问题是会养成孩子对周围的一切进行“比较”的习惯。**因为教师、父母对孩子学习成绩方面的“比较”，孩子可能逐渐发展出“比较”自己与他人的家庭条件、父母背景、老师赏识、长相优劣等。孩子们为了在“比较”中能够取胜，会偏向于追求本来不应该追求的东西。比如，追求穿更好的名牌产品，为讨好老师而逢迎拍马，为博得父母赞扬而弄虚作假。**父母和老师的“比较”方式，以及周围的环境会直接伤害孩子的心理，导致孩子出现品德问题。**

**所以说，中国教育的核心问题就是太偏重于成绩。而为了达成这个目标，学校教育和父母会使用“比较”这种错误的方式去激励孩子学习。**

我们再来说说，为什么美国的孩子看上去比中国的孩子更自信、更快乐？

**美国父母一般很少对孩子提出将来要成龙成凤的想法，他们只是希望孩子们能够健康成长。**

在美国的学校教育中，小学、初中的学习内容跟大学的学习内容基本没有关系。**美国小学和初中的学校教育主要是引导学生对知识产生好奇，使学生能够拥有良好的思维、思辨能力，安排足够的时间给孩子们参加各种各样的课外活动。****从这个意义上讲，美国的孩子是在对自我的认可、寻找自己的成长路径，以及发掘自己才华过程中长大的。**而美国的父母与老师也不会时刻对孩子进行“比较”。

**中国的孩子们不自信，其实并不是孩子们本身的问题，而是因为中国的教育体系和家长心态的偏差。**中国的教育体系和家长心态已经形成了一种像绞肉机一样的环境，没有任何一个孩子能逃避这种折磨。中国的教育制度和家长心态如何改革是很难解决的问题，但如果这些问题不解决，中国一代又一代的孩子会在这种体系和环境中深受其害，**孩子长大后可能就分化成3种人：第一种是自负傲慢的人，因为他一直比别人好；第二种是自卑胆怯的人，因为他一直比别人差；第三种是不思进取的人，因为他觉得自己比上不足比下有余。**

**中国的孩子们在成长过程中缺乏了童年的快乐、生命的热情，缺乏对知识的渴望及好奇。很多孩子们长大后就失去了对幸福、稳定、有成就感的生活的追求，也失去了拓展生活的基础能力。**当社会环境没有办法改变时，我建议家长们应该做到不要再“望子成龙，望女成凤”，而是认真思考如何在自然宽松的环境中，循序渐进地激发孩子对生命和读书的热情。因为往往在健康、快乐、积极的环境中长大的孩子，才对未来有着无穷无尽的动力，会不断追求新的成就和新的成功。

##### 评论摘抄

应试教育体制是中国特殊国情的体现。人口基数庞大，城乡差距巨大，贫富差距巨大，文化差异明显。在各种巨大差异情况下做一个“公平”的教育体系必然会产生许多的问题。这也是为什么中国高考一直被质疑但是一直无法改变的原因。   文中俞老师提到，教师考核制度与教师积极性的问题。教师是学校教书育人的前哨岗位，教师的目地本末倒置坑害无数的学生。而应试教育体制下，分数确实是最重要的东西。于是形成了一个死循环，为了公平靠分数评定升学资格，为了分数减除各项素质教育内容，学生综合素质体现中分数一枝独秀，升学考核只能是依靠分数选择。在这样的一个公平理念造成的以分数为核心的应试教育死循环里面，老师和家长都无力改变。最后只能顺应环境，随波逐流。

今日所感：在别人面前显摆是不正确的事情, 会引火自焚，发朋友圈便是显摆自己的方式，要慎之又慎！

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;晚上吃完饭朱沛琳打语音给我，把王晗的桌子放我这里，朱沛琳明天收拾完东西离开学校，学校下的通知是开完毕业典礼后给毕业生一个星期的时间离校，这让我感受到我们确实是来河南师范大学求学的，学习时间到了，就要离开学校。学校依然是这个学校，学生是新招进来的学生，刚看到学校官网在开展学校2021年防汛工作，工作照常进行，地球照常转动。可恶，可恶！朱沛琳在宿舍楼下介绍了她的同学，她们分别考入了西安电子科技大学和合肥工业大学的研究生，考入西电的同学是2000年出生，比我小3岁。我愧对父母，愧对时间。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🍛2021年6月13日，星期日，小雨，现在是端午节放假时期，昨天上午英语4级考试，感觉考试还是要多模拟，昨天整体感觉是时间不够用，虽然做题顺序有策略，但是还需要优化，平时要给自己多模拟实战的训练才行，要不然在关键时刻便会掉链子。昨下午去万达买了一双鞋和三条男士内裤，今上午去调换了内裤尺码和鞋的尺码，昨天下午跑了5km, 学校这两天有大四同学他们家长开车来接他们回家，我毕业就没有这样的待遇了，我尽可能实现在我妹上大学时我能开车去送她，上高中时每次放假，还是有些羡慕那些有家长开车来接他们回家的同学，这不是我造成的，这是我父母造成的，我不能把这份悲伤拉到自己身上，自己要做的就是让自己的下一代没有这种感觉。

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;昨晚上收到了老外的回信，有点担心他是不是同性恋，从他的e-mail中看到他现在还没有老婆，而且在昨晚的回信中，有一段让我不是很理解，甚至有点想歪的内容。

My dear Fuxiang

Thanks for your two emails. Excuse me for not responding to your previous email but these last two days have been a lot of work. Thanks for the pictures of your two classmates; They are pretty girls and seem to have a pleasant and friendly character.

I don't want to be a busybody in your life, but ¿do you have a girlfriend or is there a girl that you like or are in love with? ¿Or do you leave love in the background and are currently only focusing on your studies and your future work?

I think that within your specialty (major): computer technology, you have a field of employment that is sometimes unknown: all the electronic devices and all the technology that is focused on the communication of blind people and people with Cerebral Palsy who do not They can communicate with me verbally and that require adaptations in computers (hardware and software).

If you wish, I can send you pictures and brief explanations in English about these computing devices.

Recently, the University of Murcia (UMU) has signed a collaboration agreement with Central South University of Changsa (Hunan, China) in the framework of the institutional travel activities that the UMU has carried out in China to strengthen academic and institutional ties with various institutions. This university, recently recognized with one of the highest classifications within the Chinese university system, works closely with the Optics Laboratory of the UMU (University of Murcia) led by teacher Pablo Artal. During the meetings held, the Chinese university has shown great interest in our Faculties of Computer Science, Chemistry, Medicine and Mathematics. In addition, a collaboration agreement has been initiated on subjects of teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language and the teaching of the Chinese language with the SIDI (Language Service) of the University of Murcia.

¡Wow! If you have a good impression of the English test you took, then you will surely get a good grade. I will be very proud of you.

Unfortunately you are wrong. My level of English is terrible. I have never studied it in the Secondary or Bachelor stage or at the University. I am fluent in the French language. In English I have become used to handling educational texts and I have come to understand a large part of the vocabulary when I read, I can write fairly complex texts; but my expression (pronunciation and listening comprehension in English) is very bad and I am unable to carry on an oral conversation ...

The zongzi looks delicious. In Murcia, my city and region, we have a gastronomic dish that I think you would like: rice with vegetables.

Ingredients for four people

400 g of rice

1/2 kg fresh artichokes

250 g of aubergines

300 g cauliflower

1 red bell pepper

2 ripe tomatoes

100 gr of salted cod

1/4 liter of olive oil

1 potato

250 g of young beans shelled or 250 g of green beans

1 bunch of garlic

2 liters of water

Saffron hair

Salt

1 tablespoon of paprika

I know that there are differences between the cultural and social customs between China and Spain and that for a Chinese citizen some of our western and specifically Spanish behaviors may seem inappropriate or poorly educated, since they do not maintain a “social distance”. Most Spanish citizens are socially outgoing, talkative, affectionate and we quickly establish trust and make friends quickly. That type of behavior even for other European citizens can be strange ... Actually this extroverted character and social behavior is typical of southern European countries: Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece ...

I know that men have been educated to be tough guys and the expression of feelings or emotions can sometimes be interpreted as a sign of poor manhood. Especially when it comes to friendship between men. However, we are social beings, we have communicative and emotional needs, and I think it is essential that people who are important in our lives know that they are loved. Fuxiang don't be afraid to show your affection or the love you feel for other people, and never be afraid to express your needs for affection and love. These feelings are fundamental to the emotional and psychological balance of all people and it is a beautiful thing to share with the people we trust.

I  love the science fiction novel. In fact I have read many novels by Asimov: I Robot, Robot and Empire; Foundation, etc.

I have started to read about Liu Cixin and his novel The Three-Body Problem (Chinese: 三 体; literally: 'Three-Body'; pinyin: sān tǐ)

Liu Cixin is a mechanical engineer, he is also a fan of science fiction novels. For this work, he wrote between 3,000 and 5,000 words each day in his spare time and took 3 years to complete it11. His creative thinking is deeply influenced by Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke and Leon Tolstoy. The novel has profound social implications and the author reveals in it the principles of "cosmic sociology", a protocience about the laws of survival in the universe.

In the novel, Trisolaris is the only inhabited planet in a ternary star system (Alpha Centauri), where Trisolarians live. The planet revolves around the three suns at the same time. Due to the instability of the orbit, the Trisolarian civilizations have been destroyed countless times. Scientists in that world have been looking for the solution to the recurring catastrophe for thousands of centuries, but it seems like a dilemma with no way out unless that species finds a new home.
Trisolarians have a more advanced level of technology than humans and consider survival as their top priority. They have developed a totalitarian society and a completely different moral system from Earth.

Fuxiang, I am very happy to meet you; Although we met a short time ago, I appreciate you a lot, I already consider you as a little brother, one of my best friends, and I consider you part of my family. I wish our friendship and fraternity to be for life, if possible

Dear Fuxiang, thank you for your invitation to visit China. I would love to be able to travel in the future and meet you in person. You are also invited to visit Spain and Murcia, whenever possible in the near future. You will always be well received and the time you come on vacation you can stay at my house. Both in my apartment in Murcia and in our second residence on La Manga del Mar Menor beach there is a guest bedroom for you. Here you have your other family, your family from Spain.

I really like talking and sharing with you about any topic. I feel very comfortable and I think it can be a very enriching experience for both of us.

Take care, please. I await your news with impatience.

Many hugs.

 Roge

我的回复

Dear Roge:

 I am delighted to receive your reply. We're in different countries, we're in different places on the planet, so our lives may not be synchronized. You sent me the books you wrote through email. I think you are magnificent. The Murcia food you introduced is a little similar to a kind of food in China.

 I have a girl classmate who I like in our school. She is very beautiful, very sunny, very open, very positive. I like her very much.  

 I really like people who have an outgoing personality. I think I am an introverted person, even I have some inferiority. I feel that I lack courage and confidence in some things in my life. 

 I haven't seen the movies or books you introduced me to. But through your introduction, I feel that this is a very touching work.

 You can reply to emails in your free time. It is also a pleasure for me to communicate with you through email.

 Best wishes.

 

 Fuxiang
